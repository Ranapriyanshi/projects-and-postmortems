# Daily check-in — 2025-01-29 (Thursday)❄️❄️

## What I did today
- Explored MCP Chrome DevTools in the browser
- Watched videos on how it works and how to use it with Copilot
- Referred to documentation and websites for setup and examples

## References

- [Video: Using MCP with Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC4qH1cCZlg)

## What I learned
- **MCP Chrome DevTools + GitHub Copilot for better development.** Explored how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Chrome DevTools integration works and how to use it together with GitHub Copilot. MCP lets the AI get real context from the browser (e.g. DOM, network, console, accessibility) instead of guessing. So when you're coding with Copilot, the model can "see" what's in DevTools—elements, requests, errors—and give more accurate suggestions and fixes. In practice: you can point Copilot at live page state, network responses, or a11y issues and get code or debugging steps that match what's actually happening. Using MCP Chrome DevTools alongside Copilot makes the workflow more context-aware and can speed up debugging and front-end work.

## Work / projects
- While developing with Copilot, wanted to improvise and improve the flow even more—explored MCP Chrome DevTools so the AI can use real browser context and give better suggestions during development.

## Blockers / notes
- How can it be integrated with the current setup 
- how cab we put it in the setup folder so that no manual configuration is required
