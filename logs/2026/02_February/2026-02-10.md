# Daily check-in — 2026-02-09 (Monday)

## What I did today

* Spent time understanding the fundamentals of React Native.
* Explored how React Native differs from traditional React (web development).
* Reviewed how mobile UI components work in React Native.
* Watched tutorials and read documentation related to setup and project structure.

## What I learned

* React Native allows building mobile applications using JavaScript and React concepts.
* Instead of HTML elements, React Native uses built-in components like `View`, `Text`, and `ScrollView`.
* Styling in React Native is done using JavaScript objects similar to CSS but with some differences.
* React Native uses native platform components, which improves performance compared to hybrid frameworks.

## Work / projects

* No active project work today.
* Focused mainly on learning and strengthening foundational knowledge of React Native.

## Blockers / notes

* Need better understanding of navigation in React Native.
* Still confused about handling platform-specific features and file structure best practices.
* Need more hands-on practice to feel comfortable building UI layouts.

## Tomorrow

* Start building a small practice React Native app.
* Learn about navigation libraries like React Navigation.
* Practice creating reusable components.
