# Daily check-in — 2026-02-05 (Thursday)
What I did today

Completed fixing the remaining issues from yesterday’s dependent script work. Reviewed missing components, corrected dependency handling, and ensured the script executed more reliably.

Joined a call regarding a new production development initiative.

Got onboarded to a new project in a completely new domain involving mobile application development using React Native.

Reviewed initial requirements and started planning for the first assigned task related to SSO implementation.

What I learned

Gained more clarity on handling dependency resolution and ensuring script execution order is properly maintained.

Got initial exposure to the mobile development ecosystem and React Native workflow.

Learned about authentication requirements for mobile applications and the importance of secure and seamless SSO integration.

Work / projects

Data population: Finalized fixes and stabilized the dependent script by resolving missing references and dependency ordering issues.

New Mobile App Project: Started onboarding and requirement understanding for a React Native-based mobile application.

SSO Development: Assigned the first task to implement Single Sign-On. Currently planning to use a lock/key-based authentication approach and reviewing integration requirements.

Blockers / notes

Need to spend time understanding the new domain and mobile development architecture.

Will need to validate the authentication approach and confirm compatibility with project security standards and backend integration.

Tomorrow

Start working on the SSO implementation design and technical exploration.

Continue onboarding and understanding the React Native project structure and development workflow.
