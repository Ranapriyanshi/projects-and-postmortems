# Daily check-in — 2026-02-03 (Tuesday)🧩🍀

## What I did today
- I focused most of the day on completing the dependent script for data population and performance testing. While implementing it, I ran into issues with dependencies not resolving correctly, which led to failures in execution. I spent a good amount of time tracing the resolution order, fixing broken references, and adjusting the sequencing so the script behaves more predictably.
- On the LinkedIn front, I worked on my content strategy by drafting posts for the upcoming week, scheduling them in advance, and sending out connection invitations to people who could be valuable contacts in the future. I also did some early-stage planning around content themes and positioning.

## What I learned
- I gained a better understanding of how sensitive dependent scripts are to resolution order and structure, and how small reference issues can cascade into larger failures. This reinforced the importance of validating dependency graphs early and keeping file structures aligned with how they’re consumed.

## Work / projects
- **Data population:** Continued on the dependent script; dependency resolution and ordering need to be correct for the script to run reliably.
- **LinkedIn / content:** Content planning, post creation and scheduling for the week, and outreach via connection invitations.

## Blockers / notes
- The skills file used in the project is pointing at the wrong structure in GitHub (path or repo layout). Need to fix that so the project references the correct location.

## Tomorrow
- I’ll fix the skills file so it correctly references the intended GitHub structure and validate that everything resolves as expected. - I also plan to continue with LinkedIn content planning and scheduling to stay ahead for the coming weeks.
