# Daily Check-in — 2026-02-19 (Thursday)

# What I Did Today
- Improved the GUI of the Oval mobile app
- Added new illustrations
- Updated the color scheme
- Defined a new base style for buttons
- Refactored earlier styling decisions that conflicted with the overall app theme

# What I Learned
- Base component styles (like buttons) heavily influence overall UI consistency
- Choosing styles without validating against the full theme can create clashes
- Testing design decisions in context early prevents larger rework later
- Establishing a clear design system avoids cascading visual issues

# Work / Projects
- Oval mobile app UI refinement
- Button system redesign
- Theme and color scheme adjustments

# Blockers / Notes
- Initially selected a base button style that didn’t align with the app’s theme
- Required rework to maintain consistency across screens
- Need clearer design tokens and visual guidelines moving forward

# Tomorrow
- Audit remaining screens for consistency
- Test updated styles across different device sizes
- Finalize and document base UI components
