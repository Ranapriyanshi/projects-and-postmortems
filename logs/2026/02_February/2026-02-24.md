## What I Did
- Completed the base setup for the new application
- Interacted with a client and helped resolve a payment issue related to Cloudflare
- Performed complexity estimation for the next set of user stories
- Replicated a piece of functionality from the older codebase into the new codebase

## What I Learned
- Solid base setup reduces friction in later development stages
- Client communication requires both technical clarity and calm problem-solving
- Story estimation improves planning accuracy and workload visibility
- Code migration requires careful review to avoid carrying over legacy issues

## Notes
- Need to validate the migrated code against updated architecture standards
- Follow up to ensure the payment issue is fully resolved
