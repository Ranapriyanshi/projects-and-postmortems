# Daily check-in — 2026-02-12 (Thursday)
## What I did today

* Worked on gaining a deeper understanding of React Native architecture and core concepts.
* Reviewed and analyzed the existing codebase to understand the application flow, component structure, and state management approach.
* Explored how different screens, components, and navigation logic are interconnected.
* Studied reusable components and identified patterns used across the application.

## What I learned

* Improved understanding of React Native project structure and best practices.
* Learned how components are organized and reused across the application.
* Gained clarity on how data flows between components and how state is managed.
* Understood navigation handling and integration between different modules.

## Work / projects

* Codebase analysis and documentation for better understanding of the current application structure.
* Reviewed component hierarchy and dependencies.
* Identified areas that may require refactoring or optimization in future iterations.

## Blockers / notes

* Some sections of the codebase require additional context or documentation to fully understand their implementation.
* Need to clarify certain business logic and data handling workflows with the team.

## Tomorrow

* Continue exploring advanced React Native concepts and application architecture.
* Start implementing small changes or improvements in the codebase.
* Document findings and prepare questions or suggestions for discussion with the team.
