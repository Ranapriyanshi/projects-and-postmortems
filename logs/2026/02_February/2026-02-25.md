# Daily Check-in — 2026-02-25 (Wednesday)

# Company Work

## What I Did
- Designed and refined the database schema while iterating through the POC in detail with the team
- Participated in collaborative technical discussions to validate architecture decisions
- Worked on story allocation and task distribution across the team
- Sent across the stipend invoice
- Attended management calls focused on tech stack discussions

## What I Learned
- Database schema decisions made at the POC stage heavily influence scalability and maintainability
- Clear story allocation improves ownership and execution speed
- Tech stack discussions require balancing long-term vision with immediate delivery needs
- Cross-functional communication is as important as technical execution

## Notes
- Need to document final schema decisions clearly
- Align tech stack decisions with projected feature roadmap
