# Daily Check-in — 2026-02-21 (Saturday)

# What I Did Today
- Planned the full mascot integration across the app
- Mapped how the mascot interacts with key user journey touchpoints
- Designed new screens to support the mascot-driven experience
- Defined flow transitions between existing UI and new gamified elements

# What I Learned
- Proper planning is critical before integrating a character into multiple screens
- Mascot interactions must feel intentional, not forced
- New screens need to align with the existing design system to maintain consistency
- Gamification works best when it supports the core user goal rather than distracting from it

# Work / Projects
- Mascot integration strategy
- User journey mapping
- New screen design and layout development

# Blockers / Notes
- Need to validate whether mascot interactions add value or complexity
- Some screens may require iteration to balance usability and engagement

# Tomorrow
- Refine new screen designs
- Review flow consistency across the full mascot journey
- Prepare prototype for feedback
