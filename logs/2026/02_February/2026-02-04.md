# 📅 Daily check-in — 2026-02-04 (Wednesday)

## ✅ What I did today
- 💻 Worked on migrating scripts to a separate environment to avoid impacting the local database when multiple users access it.
- 🔍 Encountered mismatches between models and migrations, and updated the scripts to properly accommodate those changes.
- 🗄️ Set up a new database environment, ran migrations, and tested the scripts successfully on the new database.
- 🌐 Attempted to run the website using the same database, but the website is currently not starting, possibly due to a database-related issue.

## 📚 What I learned
- Better understanding of how migration mismatches between models and schema can impact script execution.
- Learned the importance of testing database changes in isolated environments before integrating them with applications.

## 🛠️ Work / projects
- Script migration and database environment setup.
- Website deployment testing with the new database configuration.

## 🚧 Blockers / notes
- Website is not starting when connected to the new database.
- Potential database configuration or migration-related issue needs investigation.

## 🎯 Tomorrow
- Investigate and identify the missing configuration or database issue preventing the website from running.
