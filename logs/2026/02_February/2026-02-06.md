# Daily check-in — 2026-02-06 (Friday)

## What I did today
- Worked on populating 50 million records for work packages. I focused on executing and monitoring the data population process to ensure the records were generated accurately and efficiently. Since this involved a very large volume of data, I paid attention to performance behavior, execution time, and stability of the script. I also verified that dependencies and references were maintained properly so the generated data could be used reliably for testing and validation purposes.
- Spent time reading about React Native and understanding how product development is carried out using the framework. I explored how React Native enables cross-platform mobile application development, how projects are structured, and how UI components, navigation, and state management are handled. I also reviewed the overall development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deployment considerations for mobile applications.

## What I learned
- Learned more about handling large-scale data population and the importance of optimizing scripts to manage high-volume data generation without causing system performance issues.
- Gained foundational knowledge of React Native architecture and how it supports building mobile applications using reusable components and shared logic across platforms.
- Developed a basic understanding of mobile product development workflows and how they differ from traditional web or backend development.

## Work / projects
- **Work Package Data Population**: Contributed to generating 50 million records to support performance testing and system readiness. Focused on ensuring data accuracy, maintaining dependency integrity, and validating successful execution of the population process.
- **React Native Learning**: Started building conceptual knowledge around mobile application development, including framework capabilities, project setup, and development best practices that will support upcoming project work.

## Blockers / notes
- Large data population processes require continuous monitoring to ensure performance remains stable and data is generated without inconsistencies.
- React Native is a new domain, so additional learning and hands-on experience will be required to become comfortable with development workflows and implementation patterns.

## Tomorrow
- Continue validating and reviewing populated data to confirm it meets performance and testing requirements.
- Continue learning React Native concepts and begin exploring practical examples and documentation to support future development tasks.
