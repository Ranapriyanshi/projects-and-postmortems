This repository is a personal workspace for documenting daily progress, technical learnings, and reflections on projects and incidents. It serves as a long-term engineering journal to capture how ideas evolve, how problems are solved, and what lessons emerge over time.

The goal is not just to track tasks, but to build a searchable history of thinking, decisions, and growth. 🚀

🧭 Overview

The repository is organized around daily logs and supporting documentation. Each day is recorded as a standalone entry, making it easy to review past work, trace decisions, and identify patterns in learning and productivity.

In addition to daily entries, this repository can host deeper project documentation and postmortems for significant technical efforts or incidents.

Daily logs follow a consistent path pattern:
logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md

This keeps the archive chronological and easy to navigate.

✍️ How to Log a Day

Start each day by copying the template file and naming it with the current date.
Fill in the entry with:
- What was worked on 🛠️
- What was learned 📚
- Blockers or challenges ⚠️
- Notes or ideas 💡
- Plans for the next day 🗓️

🔒 Logging Guidelines
All entries should follow the rules outlined in LOGGING_GUIDELINES.md.
This includes avoiding confidential information, using aliases for sensitive projects, and keeping content professional and safe to publish.

🧩 Projects and Postmortems
Beyond daily logs, this repository can include:
- Technical project documentation 📐
- Architecture notes and design decisions 🏗️
- Incident reports and postmortems 🔍
- Experiments, research notes, and long-form reflections 🧠
This makes the repo both a working journal and a personal knowledge base.

🌱 Purpose
This repository exists to:
- Maintain a consistent habit of reflection and documentation
- Capture learning in real time
- Track progress across projects and roles
- Build a long-term, searchable technical diary
- Over time, it becomes a record of how problems were approached, how skills evolved, and how decisions were were made.
